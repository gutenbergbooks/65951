</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ocean has been watched and studied for ages
in innumerable aspects—it has been looked at
from points of view wide asunder as the poles—it
has been sung of by poets, and fished in by
fishermen, and sailed over by sailors for thousands
of years; but it is still a region of mystery
and wonder. There are very many things about
the sea which are quite unknown to this day;
in fact, the science of marine phenomena is
yet in its early youth, only emerging from its
infancy. The study of the physical, chemical,
and biological conditions of the sea has always
been surrounded by a sort of halo of romance,
a scientific glamour that almost led men to
believe that such research was like fishing—valuable
results might be looked for in return
for little labour, if the proper opportunity could
be found. But the opportunity only occurred
at wide intervals, and then the happy few who
were fortunate enough to form the scientific
staff of such expeditions as that of the <i>Challenger</i>
were regarded with unmixed envy by the
many who were eager to do similar work if
they could get the chance.</p>

<p>The wonders discovered by the chief scientific
cruises of recent years have greatly increased
the interest of the public in the science
of the sea, and this public interest has quite
lately assumed a tangible form in the foundation
of the Scottish Marine Station for Scientific
Research at Granton, near Edinburgh. To understand
the importance and value of this Station,
one must know something of the difficulties
presented to any one who wishes to solve
some special problem connected with the life
which swarms in the waters around our coasts.
He must rely on the help of fishermen for
collecting specimens; and if he cannot go
to the expense of hiring a boat and crew,
he requires to content himself with any selection
of their ‘rubbish’ which they may be
pleased to make. Should he wish to examine
any locality minutely, he must purchase a dredge
and tow-nets, leads and lines, and bottles
and boxes to contain the specimens which
may be obtained. The difficulty is only half
overcome when the work of collecting is over.
It is impossible to convey the creatures alive
to any distance; and after a few attempts to
do so, the naturalist either hires a room in
the fishing-village for his work, or gives up the
study of marine life altogether; unless he steer
a middle course, and content himself with a
bare enumeration of species and a description of
the external appearance of his specimens.</p>

<p>The individual who is desirous of making
chemical or physical observations on the wide sea
is in a still more evil case. His apparatus is more
costly and more complicated than that of the
biologist; it is less easy to manage in a boat not
specially adapted for the purpose; and the
immediate vicinity of a laboratory is of the first
importance. The obstacles, in fact, are so numerous,
that observations of this nature have been
almost entirely neglected in Great Britain. Now
and then, it is true, the fire of scientific enthusiasm
burns strong enough in a man to enable
him to overcome all difficulties, and to carry on
a brilliant research with complete success to a
satisfactory conclusion. The work of such men
is monumental; but they do not appear many
times in a century. The name of one marine
chemist is associated with Edinburgh; it is that
of Dr John Murray, who in the year 1816 made
a series of researches on sea-water collected
at Trinity. His work settled a most important
point of theoretical chemistry, and it is referred
to as of value to this day.</p>

<p>That the progress of marine research was
hindered by the trouble and expense of carrying
it out—and in honesty it must be said that the
latter was always the more powerful deterrent—has
long been apparent; and for many years
attempts, more or less successful, have been made
to remedy this state of affairs. In response to
energetic appeals from various learned Societies,
government has repeatedly lent gunboats for
scientific purposes, and the <i>Porcupine</i>, <i>Lightning</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">{466}</span>
<i>Triton</i>, and other ships have done much good
work. The culmination of government enterprise
was reached in 1873, when the <i>Challenger</i>
was fitted out for an entirely scientific cruise,
and circumnavigated the world investigating the
phenomena of the ocean everywhere. How much
was accomplished by the three years’ voyage can
only be realised by those who are familiar with
the thirteen large volumes which have been
already published describing the collections and
observations; but the general reader may form
an idea of the magnitude of the work done by
reflecting that specialists have been engaged in
examining and describing the collections since
the return of the ship in 1876, and that this
work is still in progress.</p>

<p>Since the return of the <i>Challenger</i>, a number
of short scientific trips have been made in the
vicinity of the British coast by gunboats and
hired vessels; and the results of these have
been such as to show the extreme advisability of
something more permanent being set on foot.
The success of the Marine Observatories at Naples
and at Marseilles, and of the small movable
laboratory kept up for two summers by the
university of Aberdeen, proved that Marine
Stations were practicable and desirable. It was
the consideration of the difficulties in the way
of young men who wished to devote themselves
to the examination of marine phenomena, but
who were unable of themselves to meet the great
expense of such work, that led Mr John Murray,
Director of the <i>Challenger</i> Expedition Commission,
to start a Marine Station in the neighbourhood
of Edinburgh. A submerged quarry on the shore
at Granton, which quarry has been in communication
with the sea for nearly thirty years, was
selected as the site, and a floating laboratory was
formally opened there during the festivities of
the Edinburgh University Tercentenary celebration
this spring.</p>

<p>The Marine Station has now been open for
several months, and the working arrangements
have attained a certain degree of completeness.
The accommodation which exists at present includes
a floating laboratory, ‘the Ark,’ where
zoological, botanical, and chemical work is
being carried on by the permanent staff and
other investigators. There is also a steam-yacht,
the <i>Medusa</i>, fitted out with all the arrangements
for trawling, dredging, sounding, and taking the
other necessary observations. She is manned by
an efficient crew, and has the advantage of the
services of an engineer who was on the <i>Challenger</i>
during her scientific cruise. The <i>Medusa</i> is a
capital seaboat, though, from her small size,
when in rough weather, she sometimes tries
the sea-going capabilities of the workers. The
creatures brought up by the dredge or trawl
are kept alive in boxes, the water in which
must be changed at intervals, though, when
there is a heavy sea and a head-wind, as often
happens, this service is performed by the waves,
which break over the bows in magnificent
spray showers, very beautiful to watch from
the dry security of the after-cabin. On
arriving at the Ark, the animals are transferred
to aquaria or glass dishes, in which a
constant current of thoroughly aërated sea-water
can be kept up, and in these they live very
happily. The larger specimens are usually placed
in wire cages moored to the Ark, where they
enjoy all the advantages of life except freedom.
For short excursions in the neighbourhood
of Granton, there is a good sailing-boat,
the <i>Raven</i>; and work in the haven in which
the Ark lies can also be carried on by the little
<i>Dove</i>, and the two Norwegian skiffs belonging
to the Station, whose names, <i>Appendicularia</i> and
<i>Asymptote</i>, are mystifying to the uninitiated. A
row round the quarry at low water reveals the
immense richness of the vegetable and animal
life which inhabits its waters. There are growths
of sponges of different colour, with gracefully
interlacing branches like a coral grove, where
bright-hued sea-anemones spread their tentacles,
and crabs and other crustacea crawl and swim
about at their pleasure. And not only are the
commoner forms of marine life abundant; rarer
species may be found frequently. The beautiful
nudibranch mollusc <i>Eolus</i> lives in the quarry;
and the great fifteen-spined-stickleback builds its
nest there, and it has been seen keeping guard
over its door while its mate and young remain
comfortably within.</p>

<p>The work which is being carried on at the
Marine Station at present is divided between
four workers. Mr J. T. Cunningham, the naturalist
in charge, is making a research into the
development of the Teleostian fishes, the great
group to which most of our food-fishes, such as
the cod, herring, and haddock, belong. Mr J.
R. Henderson has commenced to form a collection
of all the animal life of the Firth of Forth;
while Mr John Rattray is proceeding with a
similar collection of the algæ or seaweeds, and
is also making a detailed study of the diatoms
of the district, a piece of work which has never
previously been attempted. Mr Hugh Robert
Mill has charge of the daily meteorological
observations at the Station, and he is working
at the chemical and physical study of estuary-water,
examining the variations in saltness and
in temperature which occur from the fresh
water to the open sea, and comparing them at
different seasons. The work at the Station is
thus seen to be purely scientific; and the
results which will ultimately be obtained must be
of great practical importance. Any scientific man
is welcomed to work at the Station on special
problems, without charge, and several gentlemen
have taken advantage of the privilege.</p>

<p>It may give a better idea of the working of
the various departments if the actual methods
employed be shortly described.</p>

<p>Zoological specimens are collected in various
ways. The ‘trawl’ is a wide-meshed net tied
up at one end. The net’s mouth is attached
above to a stout wooden beam that unites two
iron runners; the lower side is a strong cable,
the ground-rope, which rubs along the sea-bottom.
The fish, alarmed by the ground-rope, rise up
and are caught in the net, which is carried along
so rapidly that escape is impossible. In using
the trawl the vessel must steam quickly, and the
ground trawled over must be free from rocks.
It is only employed for the capture of the larger
kinds of fish, such as flounders, haddock, and
cod. The ‘dredge’ is the true naturalist’s implement.
It is a small-meshed net, closed at one
end, and fixed to a rectangular iron frame at
the other. When drawn along, it scrapes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">{467}</span>
bottom, and brings up everything that it encounters,
mud and shells, and all living creatures
that are not quick enough to get away.
After a run over good ground, when the
dredge is hauled up—an operation that is performed
on the <i>Medusa</i> by a gun-metal wire-rope
and a steam winch—and emptied on deck,
the profusion of animal life that lies in a
struggling heap before one is quite bewildering.
There are pectens and oysters, alcyonarians
(usually known as ‘dead-men’s-fingers’), sea-anemones
of all sizes and colours, swimming-crabs
and spider-crabs and soldier-crabs, whelks and
mussels, zoophytes and algæ, ascidians (commonly
called ‘sea-squirts’), sponges, sea-urchins, star-fishes
of every kind from the magnificent
sun-star, ‘rose-jacynth to the finger-tips,’ to
the common brittle-star and ‘five-fingers;’
and there are other things more than can be
numbered. The dredge and trawl explore the
bottom, but are useless for collecting specimens
from the surface or intermediate depths; and
‘tow-nets’—bags of muslin or canvas sewn on
hoops and drawn after the vessel—are employed
for this purpose. The creatures caught in the
tow-net are usually small; when the contents of
the net are placed in a bottle, the water seems full
of bright spots darting about in all directions; but
under the microscope the specks discover themselves
to be beautifully formed crustaceans shining
in glassy armour. But the tow-net often catches
larger things. An exquisite transparent <i>medusa</i>
or jelly-fish, its umbrella several inches in diameter,
rayed with purple, and carrying a fringe
of graceful pendent tentacles, is often brought
on board its namesake; and hosts of smaller
species of these beautiful creatures are always to
be found. It is in the tow-net, too, that the
floating ova of fishes, about which there has
been so much discussion recently, are caught.</p>

<p>The chemical and physical work done at sea
is chiefly the collection of samples of water and
the observation of temperature. Water from any
moderate depth is collected by lashing a bottle
to the sounding-line and lowering it to the
proper point; the stopper is then pulled out by
a cord and the bottle allowed to fill. The
water in the bottle is not changed in its ascent,
as the mouth is narrow and it always hangs
vertically. When the sea is rough or the depth is
great, it is necessary to employ some other means.
The ‘slip-water-bottle’ is convenient for most
purposes. It consists of a brass disc covered with
india-rubber, and supporting a central column
to which the line is attached. This is lowered
to the required depth, and then a hollow brass
cylinder, open below, but closed above except for
a hole that just allows the line to pass, is allowed
to slip down the line. The base of the cylinder
strikes on the rubber-covered disc, and securely
incloses a sample of the water, which is run
off by a stop-cock into a bottle after the whole
has been hauled on board. The water must
always be brought to the laboratory in stoppered
bottles, which are entirely filled, and have had
the stoppers tied down from the moment of
collecting.</p>

<p>The temperature of surface-water is usually
taken by drawing a bucketful and placing an
ordinary bath-thermometer in it for a few minutes.
The precautions of hanging the thermometer in
the centre of the bucket and placing it in the
shade must be observed. Temperature at greater
depths may be observed in several ways. Three
methods have been tried at the Marine Station.
The first is by means of a ‘cistern-thermometer,’
used by the late Sir Robert Christison for ascertaining
the temperature of the water in the
deep Scottish lochs, which was presented to the
Station by Sir Alexander Christison. It consists
of a thermometer, the bulb of which is
in the centre of a conical copper vessel capable
of containing about five pints. When this is
lowered into the sea, the water passes through
the instrument; but on hauling up, the valves
on the upper side are closed, and it is brought
on board full of water from the greatest depth
it had reached. Experiment shows that the
water has not had time to change its temperature
in the few minutes that elapse between
collecting it and reading the thermometer. A
more common instrument, though one not found
so suitable for use in shallow water, is the Miller-Casella
thermometer, the form chiefly employed
on the <i>Challenger</i>. It is a self-registering thermometer
with a maximum and minimum arm,
which register the highest and lowest temperatures
met with in each immersion. As the temperature
of the sea almost invariably decreases
with increase of depth, the lowest temperature is
considered to be that of the lowest point reached.</p>

<p>The third form of thermometer has been found
the most convenient, and, with some modification,
the best for the purposes of the Station. It is
Negretti and Zambra’s deep-sea thermometer, and
its principle is that when the temperature of the
water is attained by the thermometer the instrument
is made to turn over; the mercury column
always breaks at the same point, a contraction
near the bulb; the part which had been beyond
the bulb remaining in the inverted tube, which
is graduated so as to show the temperature at
the moment of inversion. Its great advantage is
that no subsequent change of temperature affects
the instrument until it is set again. Its great
defect is that it is difficult to be sure when it
has turned over. The simple and ingenious
inverting mechanism of Magnaghi is hardly
trustworthy; but an improvement has been
effected, in consequence of the experience gained
at the Scottish Station, which makes the turning
of the thermometer, or of any number of
thermometers on the same line, a matter of
certainty.</p>

<p>The transparency of the water is measured
roughly by noting the depth to which a large
white disc continues visible when immersed. In
the course of a trip from Grangemouth to the
Isle of May, the colour of the water was observed
to vary from dirty yellow to clear blue-green;
and the disc, at first visible only three feet below
the surface, was seen at a depth of six feet at
Inchgarvie, at fifteen feet off Inchkeith, and at
no less than sixty feet a little east of the May.
Although the water of the upper reaches of the
firth has been rendered muddy by the admixture
of river-water, that at the May Island remains
beautifully clear.</p>

<p>The routine-work of a biological and chemical
laboratory is not of much interest to most
people. For every day of collecting, with its
fresh sea-air and new sea-sights, there must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">{468}</span>
several spent on the Ark in preserving the
specimens, pressing plants, dissecting, mounting
microscopic objects, observing densities, analysing
water, calculating results, and such things; and
all this work does not always tend to preserve
an odourless atmosphere.</p>

<p>It is not intended that the Marine Station
shall long continue of its present small dimensions.
The experiment, so far as it has gone,
has been so successful that it is now proposed
to erect a large house on shore near the quarry,
where there will be commodious laboratories,
large aquaria, and rooms for the accommodation
of the workers. In the meantime, Mr Irvine
of Royston has generously given the use of an
old manufactory which stands close to the sea
beside the quarry. It was formerly used as
a tannery, and so contains a number of large
water-tight tanks built in the ground. There
is a steam pumping-engine; and a very simple
modification of the existing pipes will secure
the supply of abundance of sea-water. The
tanks will be used for experiments on fish-breeding;
and the buildings in the works can be employed
as laboratories without much alteration.</p>

<p>The Marine Station is intended to be a centre
from which branches will extend to other parts
of the country. It is in contemplation to erect
a permanent marine observatory on the Clyde;
and there will also be a portable station, probably
a floating laboratory on the plan of the
Ark, which can be taken to any part of the
coast where it is desirable to make an extended
series of observations.</p>

<p>The Granton Station is, with the exception of
an annual grant of three hundred pounds from
the Scottish Meteorological Society, entirely
supported by voluntary subscription; and the
heartiness with which the appeals to the public
have been responded to by donations of money,
apparatus, and material, shows how thoroughly
the people of Scotland realise the importance
of the work which is being done. The Government
Grant Committee of the London Royal
Society has made certain allowances to the
members of the scientific staff for special
researches; but this is not in any sense a
government endowment of the Station, the
Treasury having definitely refused to give any
money for such a purpose. Although government
support is an extremely desirable thing,

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX.—THE OTHER SIDE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seemed very curious to Madge that she should
become the confidant of those two men, with
whose fate that of her mother had been so sadly
associated. She was thrust into the ungracious
position of arbiter between them; she had to
decide whether or not the one was false and
treacherous, or the other the victim of his own
hasty passion and self-deceived in his accusations.
She was satisfied that Mr Beecham had spoken
under the conviction of the truth of what he told
her; and Mr Hadleigh had just shown her that—if
innocent—he could be magnanimous, by his
willingness to meet in friendliness one whom he
had so long regarded as his implacable foe.</p>

<p>The position involved so much in the result
to her and to Philip, that she felt a little
bewildered, and almost afraid of what she was
about to hear. But she could forgive: that
knowledge steadied her.</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh with his formal courtesy asked
her to be seated. He stood at the window, and
she could see that the white gloom of the coming
snowstorm was reflected on his face.</p>

<p>‘May I inquire where you have met Mr
Shield?’</p>

<p>She was obliged to reply as she had done to a
question put by Philip, which, although different,
was to the same purport: ‘I may not tell you
yet.’</p>

<p>‘Philip knows that you have met him?’</p>

<p>‘No.’ It was most uncomfortable to have to
give these evasive answers, which seemed to make
her the one who had to give explanations. She
observed that Mr Hadleigh’s heavy eyebrows
involuntarily lifted.</p>

<p>‘I ought not to have asked. Pardon me.’</p>

<p>Something in his tone and manner plainly
showed that he had penetrated her secret and
Mr Beecham’s.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry not to be able to give you a direct
answer.’</p>

<p>‘It does not matter,’ he said with a slight
movement of the hand, as if he were putting the
whole subject of her acquaintance with Shield
aside. ‘I know, from the exclamation you made
a little while ago, that he has told you with all
his bitterness why he and I have not been
friends.’</p>

<p>‘There was no bitterness, Mr Hadleigh, but
much sadness.’</p>

<p>‘I am pleased to hear it, and I will try to give
you my explanation in the same spirit. First
about George Laurence. I never heard his name
until after my marriage; and it is therefore
unnecessary to say that when I did hear it, and
learned the nature of his former relations with
my wife, it was not possible for me to receive
him in my house, or for him to regard me as a
desirable acquaintance. There were unfortunate
consequences following upon this peculiar position;
but they may pass. They made my life a
hard and solitary one.’</p>

<p>He paused, and as he looked out into the dull
atmosphere, the vague stare in his eyes, as if he
were seeking something which he could not see,
became pathetic. Madge began to understand
that expression now, and the meaning of the
melancholy, which was concealed from others
under a mask of cold reserve. She sympathised,
but could say nothing.</p>

<p>‘I never spoke to the man, and saw him only
a few times. But acquaintances of mine, who
thought the news would be agreeable to me, told
me of his ways of life and predicted the end,
which came quickly. The mistake made by
Philip’s mother and Mr Shield was in believing
that it was not until after her marriage that
Laurence neglected his business and took to dissipation.
Men who had known him for several
years previous to that date informed me that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">{469}</span>
habits were little altered after it. Nights spent
in billiard-rooms and other places; days wasted
on racecourses and his fortune squandered. He
attempted to retrieve all by one daring speculation.
Success would have enabled him to go on
for a longer or shorter time, according to the use
he made of the money; failure meant disgrace
and a charge of fraud. He failed, and escaped
the law by taking poison.’</p>

<p>‘Are you sure of this?’ ejaculated Madge,
startled and shocked by this very different version
of the sentimental story she had heard.</p>

<p>‘I will show you the newspaper report of
the inquest, and a copy of the accountant’s
report to the creditors on what estate was left.
They will suffice to satisfy you that there is
no error in anything I have said.’</p>

<p>‘Why was it that Mr Shield, who was his
most intimate friend, knew nothing of this?’</p>

<p>‘He must have known something, but not all.
His ways were quiet and studious, and what
he did see, he did not regard with the eyes
of experience. I do not think that Laurence
attempted to deceive him; for men who fall
into his course of life soon become blind to its
evils and consequences; and so, without premeditation,
he did deceive him. Mr Shield,
being a man as passionate in his friendships
as in his hates, would listen to no ill of his
friend. But there is one thing more which I
have never repeated, and never until now allowed
any one over whom I had influence to repeat.
You, however, must learn it from the lips of
one who witnessed the scene.’</p>

<p>He rang the bell, and Terry the butler appeared.
It was one of Mr Terry’s strict points
of discipline in his kingdom below stairs that
without his sanction no one but himself should
answer the drawing-room bell. Obeying a motion
of the master’s hand, he advanced with a portly
gravity becoming the dignity of his office.</p>

<p>‘You were an attendant in the Cosmos Club
about the date of my marriage?’ said the
master.</p>

<p>‘I was, sir, then, and for six months before,
and a good while after.’</p>

<p>‘You recollect what was said about the marriage
a few evenings after it took place?’</p>

<p>‘Perfectly, sir, because you told me to write
it down, as you thought some day it might be
useful to you.’</p>

<p>‘The day has come. Tell us what you heard.’</p>

<p>‘There was a small dinner-party in the strangers’
room, and I had charge of it. The gentlemen
were particularly merry, and in fact there was
a remarkable quantity of wine used. Your
marriage, sir, was mentioned; and Mr Laurence,
who was the gayest of the company, although
he took less wine than any other gentleman,
proposed the health of the happy couple. I
recollect his very words, sir. He says: “I was
in the swim for the girl myself; but this beggar,
Hadleigh, cut me out; that was luck for me,
so here’s luck to them;” and the toast was drunk
with perfect enthusiasm. Mr Laurence made
away with himself some time after; and I heard
the gentlemen whisper among themselves, when
referring to the sad event, that it was a question
of doing that or of doing a spell of penal
servitude. That’s all, sir.’</p>

<p>The master nodded: Mr Terry bowed and
retired with the portly gravity with which he
had entered.</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh turned to Madge. The butler’s
story produced the effect desired: she was convinced,
for she felt sure that no man who loved
could speak so lightly—or speak at all—of the
woman he loved in a company of club bacchanalians.</p>

<p>‘But why did you not tell this to Mr Shield?’
was her reproachful exclamation.</p>

<p>‘Because he would not listen to anything I
had to say. From the time of the marriage
until after the death of Laurence, we never met.
Then he came to me, mad with passion, and
poured out a volley of abuse. I was patient
because he was her brother; and silent because
it was as hopeless to expect a man drunk with
rage to be reasonable as one drunk with alcohol.
In his last words to me he accused me of
murder. We have never spoken together since.—Do
you think me guilty?’</p>

<p>‘I do not believe it,’ she replied decisively;
‘nor would he have believed it, if what you
have told me had been made known to him
in time.’</p>

<p>‘I am grateful to you,’ said Mr Hadleigh, bending
his head; ‘but I perceive you do not know
Mr Shield. Time and solitude alter most men,
and they must have had a peculiar effect upon
him to have enabled him to make such a deep
impression on you. He used to be obstinate to the
last degree, and once he had formed an opinion,
he held to it in spite of reason.’</p>

<p>‘He must be changed indeed, then, Mr Hadleigh.
I am sure that when he had had time to think,
he would have understood it all but’——</p>

<p>She paused; and his keen eyes rested searchingly
on her troubled face.</p>

<p>‘I know what you would say, and I see that
you have doubted me. Ah well, ah well; it is
a pity; but that, too, shall be made clear to
you, I trust.’</p>

<p>She looked up again hopefully.</p>

<p>‘Oh, if you will do that!’ The tone was
like that of an appeal.</p>

<p>‘It can be done, I think.... You have
been told that it was I who, in my enmity to
Shield, took advantage of his long absence and
silence to set abroad the report that he was
married. I did not. The story was on the tongue
of everybody hereabouts for months, and I, like
the rest, believed it. There are only two men
who would have said that I spoke the falsehood—the
one is the man who invented it;
the other is Shield himself.’</p>

<p>‘You knew the man?’</p>

<p>‘I did.’</p>

<p>‘Then why, why did you not denounce him in
time?’</p>

<p>‘Because I did not know him until after your
mother’s wedding; and then I thought she would
learn the truth only too soon for her peace of
mind.’</p>

<p>‘How did you discover him, then?’</p>

<p>‘The scoundrel revealed himself. He came to
me, and insolently told me that, knowing the state
of affairs between Shield and me, he thought he
would do me a good service. So he had given
him a blow which he would not get over in a
hurry. I knew something of the man, and at
once suspected his meaning. I inquired how he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">{470}</span>
had struck the blow; and he explained that it
was he who had brought about matters so that
when Shield came home he found his sweetheart
already married to somebody else.’</p>

<p>Poor Madge was weeping bitter tears in her
heart, but there were none in her eyes: they
were full of eagerness and wonder. She was
drawing nearer and nearer to the truth, which
would enable her to effect the purpose Philip so
much desired.</p>

<p>‘It is the advantage of my nature,’ Mr Hadleigh
went on calmly, ‘that I can listen to a scoundrel
without losing temper. On this occasion, I asked
how he knew that Shield had returned. “I have
seen him,” he said; “and he is cut up enough to
please even you. Now, having done this job for
you, I expect you to give me something for my
trouble.”—“How much?”—“A hundred is not too
much to ask for the satisfaction of knowing that
your bitterest foe has got it hot.”—I asked him
to write down that he had been the first to report
in the village that Austin Shield was married,
although at the time he had no authority for the
statement.—“That looks like a confession,” he
said.—“Exactly. I mean it to be one.”—After
thinking for a moment, the fellow said: “All
right; it won’t matter to me, for to-morrow I
am off to the diggings.”’</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh stopped and looked out at the
window again, as if the scene he was recalling
even now filled him with indignation. He
resumed:</p>

<p>‘When he had written the memorandum and
signed it, I told him my opinion of his villainous
transaction, and threatened to have him horsewhipped
through the village. At the same time
I rang the bell. Although disappointed, “Bah!”
said he; “I always thought you were a sneak,
without the pluck to give the fellow who hates
you a hiding. Shield has the right stuff in him;
he gave me the money for telling him that you
employed me to tell the lie. That paper you
swindled out of me isn’t worth a rap. You have
no witnesses.”—He got out of the room before I
could reach him, and escaped pursuit.... He
was right; the paper was useless to me.’</p>

<p>‘Who was the man?’</p>

<p>‘Richard Towers. Your aunt will tell you
what a scamp he was.’</p>

<p>‘But what motive could he have for such a
cruel wrong?’</p>

<p>‘Unknown to Shield, he was his rival; and it
was his own satisfaction he sought in spreading
the falsehood, as it was his own interests he served
by endeavouring to make capital of it out of both
Shield and me by playing upon the unfortunate
misunderstandings between us.’</p>

<p>Madge was now calm and thoughtful. She,
too, saw what a powerless instrument the villain’s
memorandum was unless it could be proved
that he had written it. Who would not say Mr
Hadleigh himself had written it, to escape blame?</p>

<p>‘Have you got the memorandum still?’ she
asked suddenly. ‘Will you give it to me?’</p>

<p>‘But it is useless, except to satisfy those who
trust me that I had no part in the disgraceful
affair.’</p>

<p>‘It is not quite useless, Mr Hadleigh. There
are letters bearing that man’s name amongst my
grandfather’s papers, and Mr Shield can compare
the handwriting. That will be enough to assure
him that you are blameless, even if he be so ungenerous
as you imagine. Give me the paper.’</p>

<p>A clever thought; and Mr Hadleigh was struck
by her quickness in seeing it and the energy with
which she took up his cause. He did not know
that she was working for Philip.</p>

<p>‘You will make a good advocate,’ he said with
that far-off look in his eyes. ‘You shall have the
paper. It is in the safe in my room.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, thank you! I will wait here till
you send it to me.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_LARGEST_STATUES_IN_THE_WORLD">THE LARGEST STATUES IN THE WORLD,
ANCIENT AND MODERN.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A piece</span> of interesting news comes to us from
Egypt regarding a discovery recently made in
Lower Egypt, by Mr Flinders Petrie, of the
fragments of a colossal statue of King Rameses
II., which, calculating the height from the fragments
which remain, must have stood considerably
over one hundred feet in height! The
material employed is granite; and the executing
of such a work in such a material, and when
completed, rearing it into position, must have
involved a profound knowledge not only of
high art but of engineering skill. Is it possible
that the statue could have been cut out
whole in one piece? If so, what lever-power
did the Egyptians possess to raise such an enormous
weight into a perpendicular position?</p>

<p>Certain it is that these ancient builders knew
well how to get over, and did get over, prodigious
difficulties, as witness their obelisks, and
the enormous stones which compose the platform
of the magnificent Temple of the Sun at Baalbec.
As there is no stone quarry near, how these
vast stones could possibly have been conveyed
thither in the first place, and then raised to their
position, has been an enigma to all modern
architects and engineers by whom the temple has
been critically examined, and who have freely
confessed that, even with all our modern science
of steam-cranes, hydraulic jacks, and railways,
the transport and raising of such immense cyclopean
masses would have undoubtedly presented
many serious difficulties, if indeed it could be
accomplished at all.</p>

<p>Many of our readers will doubtless remember
Mr Poynter’s grand picture in the Royal Academy
of London, a few years ago, entitled ‘Israel in
Egypt.’ It represented an enormous mass of
sculpture mounted on a wheeled truck, dragged
along by hundreds of the unfortunate captive
Israelites, who are smarting under the whips
of their cruel drivers. Mr Poynter had good
authority for his ‘motive-power’ as shown in his
picture. So far as we can discover from ancient
works or ancient sculptures, the hugest stone
masses were transported mainly by force of
human muscles, with few mechanical expedients.
Levers and rollers seem to have been almost,
if not altogether, unknown. The mass was
generally placed on a kind of sledge, the ground
over which it was to pass lubricated with some
oily substance, and the sheer strength of human
shoulders was then applied.</p>

<p>The most colossal and by far the most remarkable
statue of modern days is that most elaborate
and rather eccentric gift of the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">{471}</span>
nation to the people of America. Not only is
it remarkable for its enormous height and
gigantic proportions, but for the very singular
and ingenious manner in which it has been
constructed, so singular, indeed, that at first sight
it is somewhat difficult to comprehend the manner
in which it has been built up piece by piece,
especially when we mention that the several
pieces of copper composing the figure have <i>not</i>
been cast. How, then, have they been made?
This we will try to explain.</p>

<p>The statue is a female figure of Liberty, having
on her head a crown, and holding aloft in her
hand a torch. The figure is one hundred and
five feet high; but, reckoning the extreme height
to the top of the torch, the marvellous altitude
of one hundred and thirty-seven feet nine inches
is reached. The statue is to be reared on a
pedestal of solid granite eighty-three feet high,
so that the entire work will rise to the immense
height of two hundred and twenty feet nine
inches! The artist is M. Bartholdi (the family
name, by-the-bye, of the great composer best
known as ‘Mendelssohn’).</p>

<p>Having first carefully constructed a model in
clay about life-size, this was repeatedly enlarged
until the necessary form and size were obtained.
The next step was to obtain plaster-casts from
the clay, and these casts were then reproduced
by clever artists in hard wood. The wooden
blocks were then in their turn placed in the
hands of coppersmiths, who by the hammer
alone, it is stated, gave the copper sheets the
exact form of the wooden moulds or models;
and thus, in this peculiar and laborious manner,
the outside copper ‘skin’ of the statue was formed
and, to all outward appearance, completed. But
as the copper is only one-eighth of an inch thick,
an inner skin is also provided, placed about a foot
behind the first, whilst the intermediate space
will be filled in with sand, especially at the lower
extremities, to give the whole a steadfast foundation.</p>

<p>The stability of the figure will not, however,
be left to depend solely on these sheets of thin
copper and loose sand; and therefore the interior,
from top to bottom, will be strengthened by a
framework of girders and supports, by which
the whole will be knit together in one firm,
compact, unyielding mass. As the sheets of
copper and the interior framework are simply
secured in the ordinary manner by rivets, when
it is desired to remove this metallic mountain,
all that has to be done is to unrivet the several
plates, take down, and pack on board ship for
New York.</p>

<p>It is proposed to place this gigantic ‘Liberty’
on Bedloe’s Island, a very small islet lying about
two miles south of the Battery and Castle Garden,
the lowest point of the island of Manhattan on
which the city of New York is built, so that
travellers approaching the city by water on that
side will get a fine view of the statue of ‘Liberty
enlightening the World.’</p>

<p>This mighty work of art, after many years of
close and anxious labour, has recently been
formally handed over by M. Jules Ferry to the
minister of the United States, as a free gift
from the people of France to the people of
America—a token of love and admiration from
the one republic to the other—and measures are
being adopted to take the statue to pieces, with
a view to its immediate transmission to New
York, in which go-ahead city we shall doubtless
soon hear of its final erection.</p>

<p>If Mr Flinders Petrie’s discovery of the remains
of the gigantic statue of Rameses II. in Lower
Egypt, one hundred feet high of solid granite,
is the largest statue of antiquity, the ‘Liberty’
of M. Bartholdi may certainly take rank as the
most colossal production of modern days.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_GREENROOM_ROMANCE">A GREENROOM ROMANCE.</h2>
</div>


<h3 title="SCENE I.">IN THREE SCENES.—SCENE I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr Percy Montmorency</span> was seated in front
of a looking-glass in his dressing-room at the
Pantheon Theatre, habited in the costume of
Charles Surface, with the perruquier in attendance.
The name of ‘Montmorency’ was merely
a <i>nom de théâtre</i> assumed by Harry Stanley when
he adopted the somewhat singular resolution of
‘fretting and strutting his hour’ on the boards
of a metropolitan theatre; for Mr Stanley was
the only child of his father Colonel Stanley,
and consequently heir to that gallant officer’s
estates in Yorkshire and elsewhere. For the
rest, he was three-and-twenty, undeniably good-looking,
and endowed with considerable abilities.
Having completed the arrangement of the
powdered wig, the perruquier withdrew a pace
and contemplated the effect with well-simulated
admiration. ‘Mr Charles Mathews never looked
the part better, sir.’</p>

<p>The actor seemed to coincide in the opinion
of his flattering attendant, for he rose, and
surveyed himself in the glass with admiration,
which he made no attempt to conceal.</p>

<p>‘A good house, Jackson?’</p>

<p>‘Capital, sir. But a little cold. They’ll warm
up when <i>you</i> go on, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Tell the call-boy I want him, Jackson.’</p>

<p>Jackson withdrew; and Montmorency surrendered
himself to a mental soliloquy, which
assumed somewhat of this form: ‘I wonder what
my father wishes to see me about? The same
old story, I suppose—the folly and wickedness
of the step I have taken. Well, of one thing I
am certain: I am much better off in my present
position, than wedded to that Barbadoes girl,
Miss Anstruther, in spite of her money-bags,
and whom I have never seen.’</p>

<p>These reflections were put an end to by the
entrance of the call-boy.</p>

<p>‘If a gentleman giving the name of Colonel
Stanley should call, show him in here.’</p>

<p>‘He is outside, sir,’ replied the boy.</p>

<p>‘Show him in at once,’ whereupon there
entered a small wizen-faced old gentleman, with
snow-white hair, and supporting himself on a
stick. Montmorency advanced, shook hands
with a great show of cordiality, and placed a
chair, on which Colonel Stanley slowly seated
himself, gazing round the small apartment with
an unfeigned expression of curiosity. ‘So this
is a theatrical dressing-room. You are pretty
snug.’</p>

<p>The room certainly deserved the encomium of
the old colonel. Paintings in oil and water
colours nearly covered the walls; fancy pipes
and cigar-boxes and scent-bottles littered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">{472}</span>
tables; a case of champagne reposed in one
corner, while in the other was a small pile of
seltzer water.</p>

<p>The colonel, after indulging in a sigh, proceeded:
‘I have called, Harry, before I return
to Yorkshire, to make one more appeal to you
to give up your present mode of life, settle
down as a landed proprietor in your native
county, and marry Miss Anstruther.’</p>

<p>It was now the turn of the young man to sigh
as he replied: ‘Impossible, my dear sir. I am
already wedded—to the stage.’</p>

<p>‘That may be; but unions can easily be dissolved
by a divorce, especially in these days.’</p>

<p>‘Not where the contracting parties are so
attached to each other as I am to my profession.
No, sir. If a man could take a wife on lease,
for seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years, the case
would be different. But the feeling that my lot
in life was fixed—cut and dried, so to speak—the
matter won’t bear a thought.’ The young man
felt strongly inclined to indulge in a stage-walk,
but the limited area of the apartment forbade
such a physical relief. If the reader should
consider the remarks of the actor somewhat
flippant, it must be borne in mind that no one
whose character did not fall under that definition
would have acted as Harry Stanley had
done.</p>

<p>The old man scowled as he resumed: ‘I
wonder you can respect yourself, dizened out
and painted like a mummer at a pantomime.’</p>

<p>‘I am of the same calling as the glory of
England, Shakspeare the actor’——</p>

<p>‘And poet—you forget that, sir—poet, sir,’
sharply retorted the colonel.</p>

<p>‘I can assure you, sir, we have men of good
family playing very small parts to-night. Trip
took honours at Oxford, and Backbite is a Cambridge
man.’</p>

<p>‘Pray, sir,’ replied the colonel, ‘if that be the
case, why do you all sail under false colours?
Why resign the honoured name of Stanley for
the Frenchified one of Montmorency?’</p>

<p>The young man bowed as he responded: ‘Out
of deference to the shallow scruples of the
narrow-minded portion of Society.’</p>

<p>‘Of which I constitute a member, eh?’</p>

<p>It was in a more conciliatory tone that his
son took up the argument. ‘Pray, sir, let me
ask you a question. Do poets and novelists
never adopt a <i>nom de plume</i>? Did not Miss
Evans style herself “George Eliot;” the late
Governor-general of India, “Owen Meredith;”
Mademoiselle de la Ramée, “Ouida;” Dickens,
“Boz?”’</p>

<p>‘That’ll do,’ interrupted the colonel. ‘Then
one fine day you will be falling in love, as
you call it, with one of these artful and painted
sirens, and I shall find myself grandfather to a
clown or a pantaloon! For, of course, you will
bring up your offspring to <i>the</i> profession, as you
call it, as if there were no other profession in
the world.’</p>

<p>His son and heir drew himself proudly up as
he replied: ‘No, sir; I trust I shall never forget
that I own the honoured name of Stanley.’</p>

<p>The colonel remained silent for several moments
ere he observed: ‘I shall never understand
why you declined even to see Miss
Anstruther.’</p>

<p>‘Because the very fact that the lady was
labelled my future wife,’ replied his son, ‘would
have caused me to detest her at first sight.’</p>

<p>The old colonel rose from his seat. ‘I can see
very plainly that I am wasting both your time
and my own.—I suppose you will have to do a
little “tumbling” presently?’</p>

<p>‘I do not make my first entrance till the
third act. If you will go in front, you can
have my box.’ Montmorency rang the bell as
he spoke, and when the call-boy appeared,
directed him to show his visitor into box A.</p>

<p>The actor was indulging in a sigh of relief,
when a head appeared at the half-closed door,
and a voice exclaimed: ‘May I come in?’</p>

<p>Montmorency bounded from his chair as he
seized hold of the extended hand and drew the
owner into the room. The new-comer was a
young man of about the same age as the actor,
and was habited in modern evening dress.
Montmorency wrung the hand of his friend Vallance,
and forced him into a seat. ‘Delighted
to see you, Jack! Have a weed and a seltzer?’</p>

<p>In a few seconds the two young men were
similarly occupied, and immersed in the consumption
of a couple of choice Partagas.</p>

<p>The actor opened the ball. ‘You must have
met an elderly party in the passage. That was
the governor. He is very irate because I won’t
fall in love by word of command, and marry
Miss Anstruther, whom I have never seen.—By-the-bye,
<i>you</i> have seen her. What is she like?’</p>

<p>‘A lovely girl,’ replied Vallance. ‘I met her
at a ball at Scarborough, soon after her arrival
from the West Indies. Faith, Harry, you might
do worse.’</p>

<p>‘And might do better; eh, Jack? But your
ideas of beauty are so opposite to mine, as I
remember of old. Now, if you wish to see a
perfect vision of loveliness, go in front and see
Fonblanque, the Lady Teazle of to-night.’</p>

<p>‘You mean <i>Miss</i> Fonblanque, I presume?’</p>

<p>‘Exactly. The prefix “Miss” is frequently
omitted in theatrical parlance. She is bewitching!’</p>

<p>Vallance shakes his head. ‘Have a care, Harry.
It would be a pity if you allied yourself with
some unknown adventuress, after refusing the
rich Miss Anstruther.’</p>

<p>‘Well, to be candid, Jack, I <i>am</i> afraid of
myself. If I did not constantly call to my mind
the fact that I am a Stanley, I should speedily
succumb to the charms of the divine Fonblanque,
so there is some benefit arising from birth after
all.’</p>

<p>‘And how long do you mean to pursue this
mad freak of yours?’ inquired Vallance.</p>

<p>‘Till I hear on good authority that the troublesome
Miss Anstruther is engaged, or married.’</p>

<p>‘And then?’</p>

<p>‘Why, then I quit the mimic stage as suddenly
as I entered upon it.’</p>

<p>‘Meanwhile!’ ejaculated Vallance with an
incredulous smile.</p>

<p>‘Meanwhile,’ replied Montmorency loftily, ‘I
contribute to the “gaiety of nations,” as Johnson
said of Garrick; and therefore consider myself
a far better member of society than a successful
general, who has killed so many hundreds
of his fellow-mortals; or a lawyer, who
has set whole families by the ears in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">{473}</span>
fill his pockets; or a doctor, who, as Tobin
says, spends the greater part of his time in
writing death-warrants in Latin.’</p>

<p>Vallance examined his finger-nails for a few
seconds, and after an embarrassing pause,
said: ‘Harry, I am about to make a confession.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot promise you absolution, Jack.’</p>

<p>Vallance proceeded: ‘On the memorable night
when I first beheld Miss Anstruther at the ball
at Scarborough, I fell over head and ears in
love with her.’</p>

<p>‘You fell in love with her, did you!’ repeated
Montmorency, in a tone of some annoyance.
‘You mean with her banking account. Remember,
you are in the confession box.’</p>

<p>‘On my honour, no!’ replied Vallance. ‘As
you are aware, I could not afford to marry a
penniless girl; but if I were as rich as Rothschild,
and Miss Anstruther a pauper, I would
marry her to-morrow, if she would have me.—You
do not seem to like the idea?’</p>

<p>‘Humanity is a strange compound, Jack. It
grates upon my sense of propriety that any one
else should step into my shoes and wed the
woman intended for my wife, yet whom I have
vowed never to marry.’</p>

<p>‘Why, what a dog in the manger, you are!’</p>

<p>‘I would not so much mind if a stranger
were to win the heiress; but to know her as
your wife, Jack, for the remainder of my existence,
to repent probably of my obstinacy—— You
are not in earnest, Jack?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, but I am!’ replied Vallance, inwardly
murmuring: ‘May I be forgiven the lie!’</p>

<p>After a brief mental struggle, Montmorency
continued: ‘Well, success attend you. You are
a lucky fellow to walk off with such a prize;
while I—I shall remain a humble stage-player.’</p>

<p>‘Remember the peerless Fonblanque, Harry.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! you are right. There is beauty, talent,
wit, elegance, refinement, all enshrined in the
admirable Lady Teazle of to-night. I shall
now no longer hold back. To-night I shall
know my fate. You have applied the touchstone.’</p>

<p>The shrill voice of the call-boy now uttered
the words ‘Charles Surface.’</p>

<p>‘There is my call. So adieu for the present.
Go in front, and call for me at the end of the
show; and we will have a steak at the <i>Albion</i>
together, and drink to the speedy nuptials of
my <i>bête noire</i>, Miss Anstruther.’</p>

<p>‘With whom?’</p>

<p>‘Any one! I care not—no offence, Jack—so
I am free.’</p>

<p>Vallance proceeded straight to box A, and
having tapped at the door, found himself face
to face with Colonel Stanley, who eagerly
exclaimed: ‘Well, Vallance, has my plan succeeded?’</p>

<p>‘I fear not, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Give him a second dose the first opportunity.
I never knew it fail. If you want to make a
man fall in love with a particular woman, tell
him she is half engaged, and she will instantly
go up twenty per cent. in his estimation. That
is how I came to marry his mother. Directly
my father told me that Fred Spencer was mad
after her, and that she was half inclined to
marry him, I rushed to the attack, stormed
the fortress, and carried off the prize! <i>I</i> wasn’t
going to let that puppy Spencer march off with
her. A fellow with not a tithe of my personal
recommendations.’ Here the colonel paused, as
he beheld the countenance of his auditor completely
engrossed with the scene; for in the
lovely Lady Teazle of the play, Jack Vallance
had recognised the West Indian heiress, Emily
Anstruther!</p>


<h3>SCENE II.</h3>

<p>Along one of the tortuous passages leading to
the dressing-rooms, a gentleman is conducting
a lady, preceded by the dresser. They have
evidently come from the audience part of the
theatre, as they are both in modern evening
dress. Presently the dresser pauses at a door,
and after tapping, enters; and returns to invite
the lady to invade the sacred precincts of the
dressing-room of Miss Fonblanque, the representative
of Lady Teazle. After a few whispered
words to her escort, the lady accepts the invitation,
and in another moment is clasped in the
embrace of the actress. ‘My dear Julia!’</p>

<p>‘My darling Emily!’</p>

<p>Certainly, Lady Teazle fully deserved the
rapturous praises of Montmorency. Her lovely
dark eyes shone all the brighter from the
contrast to the powdered wig; while her
splendid figure was displayed to the utmost
advantage by means of her handsome brocaded
dress.</p>

<p>‘And so you recognised me under these tinsel
robes, Julia?’</p>

<p>‘Your voice is unmistakable; I should have
known it anywhere, Emily.—When do you
intend to return to your own sphere?’</p>

<p>‘First tell me, Julia, how you managed to
penetrate these sacred precincts?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! my husband, who knows everybody, said
he could at once accomplish it, directly I told
him you were my old schoolfellow at Barbadoes.—Now,
answer me my question, there’s a
dear!’</p>

<p>‘I <i>have</i> found my proper sphere; I am free,
popular, and admired. Instead of one admirer,
I have hundreds, and the number is increasing
nightly. What can woman wish for more?’</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell you, Emily: a nice husband, and
domestic bliss.’</p>

<p>The actress indulged in a scarcely audible
sigh. ‘That might have been my lot. I mean
the domestic bliss part of the affair, if I had
not had it dinned into my ears from morning
till night that there was only one road to
happiness—a union with Mr Stanley, whom I
have never seen.’</p>

<p>‘You might have liked him very much.’</p>

<p>‘Impossible, my dear Julia. The very fact
of a man being ticketed like a prize animal at
a show, and then his being introduced to you
as your certain and future husband, would be
quite sufficient to make me detest him.—No,
Julia; when <i>I</i> marry, I will myself make the
selection, and he must be one who is ignorant
that his intended is a rich heiress.’</p>

<p>‘That will not be a very easy matter to
accomplish, Emily.’</p>

<p>‘Listen, Julia, and I’ll tell you a secret. There
is a young man acting in this company—a Mr
Percy Montmorency. He is all I could wish—handsome,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">{474}</span>
clever, accomplished, and vastly agreeable.’</p>

<p>‘Then you have <i>made</i> your selection?’</p>

<p>‘Not so, Julia. His profession renders our
union impossible. He may be heir to a peerage;
he may be a lawyer’s clerk. There is the most
delightful mystery as to our antecedents, we play-actors!
For instance, who would suppose that
I was the rich West Indian heiress, who utilised
her amateur theatrical talents, and adopted her
present profession? And all in order to escape
being pestered into an unwelcome and distasteful
marriage. Heigh-ho! I wish I had never seen
this captivating fellow.’</p>

<p>Mrs Sydney sighed as she rejoined: ‘Ah,
Emily, there is the danger of your present mode
of life. Before you know where you are, finding
yourself over head and ears in love with some
handsome fellow, even of whose very name you
are ignorant. As to the position in society of
his progenitors, that is a point which would
require the research of the Society of Antiquaries.’</p>

<p>The actress looked solemnly in the face of her
friend, and taking both her hands within her
own, replied: ‘Julia, there is a fascination in
the life of a successful actress, of which you can
form no conception. There is the delight of
selecting the costume you are to wear on the
eventful evening. No trifle to a woman, as you
will admit. Then there is the actual pleasure of
wearing it, not for the sake of some half-dozen
friends, whose envy in consequence is a poor
reward, but the object of admiration to hundreds
of spectators nightly! Then, instead of monotonous
domesticity, executing crewel-work to the
accompaniment of the snoring in an armchair
of a bored husband, we have the nightly welcome
from a thousand pair of hands, and the final
call before the curtain amidst an avalanche of
flowers! Your name on every tongue, your photo.
in every print-shop in London, and your acts
and deeds the subject of conversation at every
dinner-table in the metropolis!’</p>

<p>Mrs Sydney shook her head with a melancholy
smile as the actress finished her oration. ‘I am
still unconverted, Emily.’</p>

<p>‘Quite right, Julia. If we were all actresses,
there would be no audiences.’</p>

<p>The inexorable call-boy here put a compulsory
finish to the interview between the two friends,
with the words ‘Lady Teazle.’</p>


<h3>SCENE III.</h3>

<p>Montmorency was seated in the greenroom at
the conclusion of the play, engaged in that absent
train of thought known as a brown-study. The
more he saw of the fascinating Fonblanque, the
more he was captivated. Every hour spent in
her society but served to rivet more closely the
chain which bound him to her. Should he
condescend and make her an offer of his hand,
she would naturally be influenced by a profound
sense of gratitude, when she discovered that she
had married a man of fortune and a Stanley!
Whereas, if he had married the rich Miss
Anstruther, he would have had her money-bags
perpetually thrown in his face. A silver-toned
utterance fell on his ears. Looking up, he
beheld the subject of his cogitations.</p>

<p>‘Allow me to congratulate you, Mr Montmorency,
on your Charles Surface this evening.
A double call before the curtain, and well
deserved.’</p>

<p>‘You are pleased to flatter me. The plaudits
of the house to-night render any praise on my
part of your Lady Teazle unnecessary. I regret
that I am fated to lose so charming a compatriot.’</p>

<p>Was it fancy that Montmorency imagined he
detected a paler tint on the cheek of the actress,
as she replied: ‘You are not going to leave
us?’</p>

<p>‘I fear so.’</p>

<p>‘Wherefore?’</p>

<p>‘You are the last person to whom I can confide
the cause of my sudden departure.’</p>

<p>Lady Teazle cast down her lovely eyes for a
brief space, and then, in a voice in which the
smallest possible <i>tremolo</i> was perceptible, whispered:
‘Are you not happy here?’</p>

<p>‘I fear, too much so,’ sighed Montmorency.
‘I have been living in a fool’s paradise lately.’</p>

<p>‘How? In what way, Mr Montmorency?’</p>

<p>‘I am in love.—You start. You do not believe
in an actor, who is always simulating affection,
ever falling under the influence of a real and
veritable passion.’</p>

<p>‘You wrong me; indeed, you do. The artistic
nature is, and must be, more acutely sensitive
than that possessed by ordinary mortals. Do I
know the lady?’</p>

<p>‘You see her every day—when you contemplate
those charming features in the glass. Yes;
it is <i>you</i>, Miss Fonblanque, whom I love, whom
I adore!’</p>

<p>How can we describe the flood of sensations
which agitated the bosom of the heiress, as she
listened to the avowal of affection from the lips
of the only man she had ever loved! In low
and trembling tones, she managed to reply: ‘Mr
Montmorency, you are not rehearsing a scene in
some new comedy?’</p>

<p>‘I was never more serious in my life.’</p>

<p>By this time, the pride of the Anstruthers
had come to the assistance of the heiress. ‘I
grieve very much that I cannot accept your offer.
It is impossible.’</p>

<p>‘Impossible! Why?’</p>

<p>‘That I cannot explain.’</p>

<p>‘We are both members of the same profession,
and so far equal.’</p>

<p>‘Pardon me,’ said Lady Teazle. ‘You know
nothing of my antecedents, and’——</p>

<p>‘And you know nothing of mine, you would
say. Charming equality! Say, Miss Fonblanque,
may I hope?’</p>

<p>It was now the turn of the actress to sigh.
‘It would be cruel to raise hopes which can
never be realised.’</p>

<p>Montmorency let fall the hand which in his
ardour he had seized, and drew himself proudly
up. ‘That is your fixed answer?’</p>

<p>‘It is.’</p>

<p>Montmorency once more took possession of her
taper fingers, and raising them to his lips, uttered
the word ‘Farewell!’ and hastily left the greenroom.</p>

<p>The dark melting eyes of the heiress gazed
after his retreating figure, and large drops of
moisture gathered in them. ‘I have half a mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">{475}</span>
to call him back,’ she mentally whispered.—‘No!
I must remember I am an Anstruther.’</p>

<p>Sinking on a couch, Lady Teazle felt her
brain spinning round; then presently raising
her eyes, she beheld—Mr Vallance!</p>

<p>‘Have I not the honour of speaking to Miss
Anstruther?’</p>

<p>‘Since you recognise me, it would be affectation
to deny my identity. Mr Vallance, may I ask
you to preserve my secret?’</p>

<p>‘From all save one individual—Mr Montmorency.
Surely you knew that in the Charles
Surface of this evening you beheld your rejected
lover, Mr Stanley?’</p>

<p>A film came slowly over the eyes of Miss
Anstruther. ‘You are not joking, Mr Vallance?’</p>

<p>‘The matter is too serious for jesting. But I
will break a confidence. He loves you. He told
me so half an hour ago.’</p>

<p>The heiress could scarcely forbear a smile, as
she reflected that her ears had drunk in the soft
confession only five minutes ago. ‘Mr Vallance,
will you do me a favour? Will you ask Mr
Stanley to step here for a few minutes? But
remember, you must on no account reveal my
identity.’</p>

<p>‘You may rely upon me, Miss Anstruther. I
do not know what steps you mean to adopt; but
there is no time to lose, for old Colonel Stanley
is in front, and will, if he has recognised you,
at once inform his son.’</p>

<p>‘That is my fear; so haste.’</p>

<p>Almost before the heiress could mature her
plans, the rejected one appeared before her. He
was very grave, and bowed with an air of deep
humility, as the actress thus addressed him: ‘Mr
Vallance and I are old acquaintances, so I commissioned
him to ask you to return for a short
time. I feel very anxious about our scenes in
the <i>Hunchback</i> to-morrow. Would you mind running
through the Modus and Helen scenes?
I mean the second one.’</p>

<p>Montmorency bowed. ‘With pleasure.’</p>

<p>It would have been a lesson for half the
actresses on the stage, could they have beheld
the manner in which the saucy coquette of the
play coaxed her lover, lured him on, fascinated
him, and enveloped him in such a spell of
witcheries, that no Modus that ever breathed
could have been proof against her seductive
wiles. The scene came to an unexpected termination,
for Montmorency suddenly caught her in
his arms, and as he held her clasped tight to
his breast, exclaimed in rapid and excited tones:
‘This is not acting! If it be, you are the
greatest actress that ever trod the boards. You
love me! I see it in your sparkling eye; I
read it in your blushing cheek! Say, am I
not right?’</p>

<p>Emily Anstruther remained perfectly passive
in the arms of Harry Stanley, as she murmured
‘Yes!’</p>

<p>The enraptured couple were so completely
absorbed in reading love in each other’s eyes,
that they had not observed the entrance of two
gentlemen, Colonel Stanley and Mr Vallance.</p>

<p>The old colonel was the first to speak. ‘Speak,
sir! Is this a scene from a play?’</p>

<p>By this time the heiress had left the sweet
anchorage of her lover’s arms, and advancing to
the old man, said: ‘Do you not recognise your
godchild, Emily Anstruther?’</p>

<p>But surprise had taken away the power of
speech from the colonel.</p>

<p>His son interposed. ‘I trust Miss Anstruther
will acquit <i>me</i> of any guilty knowledge of this
fact—will believe that <i>I</i> believed she was
merely Miss Fonblanque the actress.’</p>

<p>Emily Anstruther here cast down her eyes,
while a deep blush mantled over her face and
neck. ‘I am afraid <i>I</i> am not equally innocent;
for Mr Vallance informed me that I had refused
my hated lover. But I have enough confidence
in <i>his</i> love for me, to hope for his belief in
my unselfish love for <i>him</i>.’</p>

<p>‘So you see, dad,’ exclaimed the younger
Stanley, ‘Love not only rules the court, the
camp, the grove, as the poet says, but does
not disdain to flutter his wings in the greenroom.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HUMOROUS_DEFINITIONS">HUMOROUS DEFINITIONS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A smart</span>, pithy, or humorous definition often
furnishes a happy illustration of the proverbial
brevity which is the soul of wit. Wit itself
has not inaptly been called ‘a pleasant surprise
over truth;’ and wisdom, often its near ally,
is, in the opinion of a clever writer, ‘nothing
more than educated cunning.’ ‘Habits are what
we learn and can’t forget,’ says the same author,
who also defines silence as ‘a safe place to hide
in,’ and a lie as ‘the very best compliment that
can be paid to truth.’ ‘Show him an egg and
instantly the air is full of feathers,’ said a
humorist, defining a sanguine man. ‘A moral
chameleon’ is a terse reckoning-up of a humbug.
Man’s whole life has been cynically
summed up in the sentence, ‘Youth is a
blunder; middle life, a struggle; and old age, a
regret.’</p>

<p>Whimsical definitions are sometimes quite
as neat and telling as those of a smarter
kind. Dr Johnson confessed to a lady that
it was pure ignorance that made him define
‘pastern, the knee of a horse;’ but he could
hardly make the same excuse for defining pension,
‘an allowance made to any one without
an equivalent.’ A patriot, some writer tells us,
is ‘one who lives <i>for</i> the promotion of his
country’s union and dies <i>in</i> it;’ and a hero,
‘he who, after warming his enemies, is toasted
by his friends.’</p>

<p>Of juvenile definitions, ‘dust is mud with
the juice squeezed out;’ scarcely so scientific
as Palmerston’s definition of dirt as ‘matter
in the wrong place.’ A fan, we learn, is ‘a
thing to brush warm off with;’ and a monkey,
‘a small boy with a tail;’ ‘salt, what makes
your potatoes taste bad when you don’t put
any on;’ ‘wakefulness, eyes all the time coming
unbuttoned;’ and ‘ice, water that stayed out
too late in the cold and went to sleep.’</p>

<p>A schoolboy asked to define the word ‘sob,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">{476}</span>
whimpered out: ‘It means when a feller don’t
mean to cry and it bursts out itself.’ Another
defined a comma as ‘a period with a long tail.’
A youngster was asked to give his idea of the
meaning of ‘responsibility,’ so he said: ‘Well,
supposing I had only two buttons on my trousers,
and one came off, all the responsibility would rest
on the other button.’</p>

<p>‘Give the definition of admittance,’ said a
teacher to the head-boy. This went from the
head to near the foot of the class, all being
unable to tell the meaning of it, until it reached
a little boy who had seen the circus bills posted
about the village, and who exclaimed: ‘Admittance
means one shilling, and children half-price.’</p>

<p>‘What is a junction, nurse?’ asked a seven-year-old
fairy the other day on a railway platform.—‘A
junction, my dear?’ answered the
nurse, with the air of a very superior person
indeed: ‘why, it’s a place where two roads
separate.’</p>

<p>To hit off a jury as ‘a body of men organised
to find out which side has the smartest lawyer,’
is to satirise many of our ‘intelligent fellow-countrymen.’
The word ‘suspicion’ is, in the
opinion of a jealous husband, ‘a feeling that
compels you to try to find out something which
you don’t wish to know.’ A good definition of
a ‘Pharisee’ is ‘a tradesman who uses long
prayers and short weights;’ of a ‘humbug, one
who agrees with everybody;’ and of a ‘tyrant,
the other version of somebody’s hero.’ An
American lady’s idea of a ballet-girl was, ‘an
open muslin umbrella with two pink handles;’
and a Parisian’s of ‘chess, a humane substitute
for hard labour.’ Thin soup, according to an
Irish mendicant, is ‘a quart of water boiled down
to a pint, to make it strong.’</p>

<p>Of definitions of a bachelor—‘an un-altar-ed
man,’ ‘a singular being,’ and ‘a target for a miss,’
are apt enough. A walking-stick may be described
as ‘the old man’s strength and the young
man’s weakness;’ and an umbrella as ‘a fair and
foul weather friend’ who has had ‘many ups
and downs in the world.’ A watch may be hit
off as a ‘second-hand affair;’ spectacles as ‘second-sight’
or ‘friendly glasses;’ and a wig as ‘the
top of the poll,’ ‘picked locks,’ and ‘poached
hare.’ And any one who is troubled with an
empty purse may be comforted with the reflection
that ‘no trial could be lighter.’</p>

<p>‘Custom is the law of fools,’ and ‘politeness
is half-sister to charity’—the last a better definition
than that which spitefully defines polite
society as ‘a place where manners pass for too
much, and morals for too little.’ ‘Fashion’ has
been cleverly hit off as ‘an arbitrary disease
which leads all geese to follow in single file the
one goose that sets the style.’ An idea of the
amusement of dancing is not badly conveyed by
the phrases ‘embodied melody’ and ‘the poetry of
motion.’</p>

<p>The ‘Complete Angler’ as a definition of ‘a
flirt’ is particularly happy. Beauty has been
called ‘a short-lived tyranny,’ ‘a silent cheat,’
and ‘a delightful prejudice;’ while modesty has
been declared ‘the delicate shadow that virtue
casts.’ Love has been likened to ‘the sugar in
a woman’s teacup, and man the spoon that stirs
it up;’ and a ‘true-lover’s-knot’ may not inaptly
be termed ‘a dear little tie.’ Kisses have variously
been defined as ‘a harmony in red,’ ‘a
declaration of love by deed of mouth,’ and
‘lip-service.’</p>

<p>‘Matrimony’ was defined by a little girl at
the head of a confirmation class in Ireland, as
‘a state of torment into which souls enter to
prepare them for another and better world.’</p>

<p>‘Being,’ said the examining priest, ‘the answer
for purgatory.’</p>

<p>‘Put her down!’ said the curate, much ashamed
of his pupil—‘put her down to the foot of the
class!’</p>

<p>‘Lave her alone,’ quoth the priest; ‘the lass
may be right after all. What do you or I know
about it?’</p>

for the money. The channel is being dredged
out by enormous machines, which scoop out the
softer earth and operate upon the debris of
harder rocks, after the latter have been blasted.
Colon, the Atlantic terminus of the canal, has,
from the miserable and dirty little village which
it presented some years ago, sprung into a prosperous
town. The dry season has unfortunately
been an unhealthy one, and there has been an
epidemic of marsh-fever; but altogether we may
take the general report of the Canal works as a
satisfactory one. There is little doubt that the
great work of uniting the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans will be accomplished within very few
years.</p>

<p>News has been received by the Geographical
Society that their intrepid explorer, Mr Joseph
Thomson, whose departure some months ago on
an expedition to the region east and north-east
of Lake Victoria Nyanza we briefly chronicled
at the time, has safely returned to Zanzibar.
Little is at present known as to what he has
done, further than that he has successfully carried
out his programme with the most satisfactory
feature that the work has been done without
any loss of life except from disease. We may
look forward with great interest to Mr Thomson’s
account of this his third successful expedition,
the more so, as this time he has journeyed in
a region of Africa untraversed by any previous
explorer, and about which, therefore, the knowledge
possessed by our best geographers is open
to improvement.</p>

<p>From a paper recently read before the
Institution of Civil Engineers, by Mr G. H.
Stayton, upon the Wood-pavements of London,
we glean the following interesting particulars:
The metropolis comprises nearly two thousand
miles of streets, of which only fifty-three miles
are at present laid with wood. Most of the
wood used is in the form of rectangular blocks
of yellow deal, principally Swedish. Neither
elm nor oak will stand changes of temperature
sufficiently well to fit them for this purpose;
but pitch-pine answers well, and so does larch;
though the supply of the latter limits its use.
Creosoting the blocks has no value as a preservative,
and the wood is now used plain, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">{477}</span>
joints being filled in with cement. The average
cost of laying wood-pavement is about ten
shillings and sixpence per square yard, and the
expenses of maintenance compare very favourably
with Macadam and other systems of pavement.
‘There is nothing new under the sun,’ even
in the matter of wood-pavements, for we find,
on reference to a <i>Mechanic’s Magazine</i> dated
1858, that wood-blocks, placed grain uppermost,
as in all modern systems, are distinctly advocated
as having many advantages over granite roads,
diminution of cost and durability being among
those stated.</p>

<p>It has become customary to speak of the
present epoch as the ‘Iron Age,’ in order to
distinguish it from those two long periods of
human interest known respectively as the Stone
Age and the Bronze Age. But future historians
may well be tempted to substitute the word
steel for iron, for it is an undoubted fact that
improved processes of manufacture, and the
resulting easy and cheap production, are causing
steel to be widely substituted for its parent
metal. In railways, steel rails are now almost
entirely replacing iron ones, and that modification
of the metal known as ‘mild steel’ is finding
great favour just now among shipbuilders.
The Board of Trade have lately had representations
made to them that the superiority of steel
over iron for shipbuilding purposes should be
officially recognised; and that this request is
well grounded, the following instances will go
far to prove. A steamer wrecked on the coast
of the Isle of Wight remained for ten days in
stormy weather perched on a ledge of rocks
without breaking up. ‘If,’ says the engineer’s
Report, ‘she had been built of iron instead of
steel, there is not a doubt that she would have
gone to pieces. The agent of another vessel
wrecked at New Zealand last year reports to
the owner that the vessel was eventually
released from her rocky bed; ‘but, with a
large number of passengers, would have been
lost, had it not been for the beautiful quality
of the material of which she is built, known
as mild steel.’</p>

<p>But there is one branch of the metal trade
which shows a continually increasing activity,
and which need not fear any rivalry from steel,
and that is the tinplate trade. Many thousands
of tons of this tinned iron—that is, thin sheets
of iron coated with tin—are annually exported
from this country, our best customers being the
United States. We may presume that a large
quantity of this metal comes back to us in the
form of tins containing preserved meats, fish,
and fruit. In Philadelphia, there are a number
of factories for utilising these tins after they
have been used. They are collected from the
ash-heaps, the hotels and boarding-houses. The
solder is melted and sold, to be used again;
the tops and bottoms of the tins are turned
into window sash-weights; the cylindrical portions
are rolled out flat, and are made into covers
for travelling trunks, and are used for many
other purposes. The industry is said to be a
very profitable one, for the expense of gathering
the tins is covered by the sale of the solder,
and the capital required is small. Such ingenious
applications of waste materials most certainly
deserve to succeed.</p>

<p>What is known as ‘flashed glass’ consists of
common white glass blown with a layer of
coloured glass superposed on its surface, which
surface can afterwards be eaten away in parts
by the application of fluoric acid, so that any
ornament or lettering can be executed upon it.
The same principle in an extended form has
lately been applied by Messrs Webb of Stourbridge
to the production of most beautiful
vases in what has been aptly called cameo
glass. The vase is first blown in glass of three
different descriptions, fused together, forming
eventually three distinct layers of material—the
innermost of a semi-opaque colour, the next
white, and the outside of a tint to harmonise
with the first or innermost. Now comes the
artist’s work. The design being drawn upon
the surface, the outer colour is removed so as
to leave but a tint, deep or light as may be
wanted in certain parts; next, the white is
cut into so as to show up where required the
ground colour behind. In this way the most
intricate design is produced with the most
artistic results. The operator employs not only
fluoric acid, but makes use of the steel point,
and also the ordinary emery wheel commonly
used for engraving and cutting glass. Two of
these vases are, as we write, on view at Mr
Goode’s, South Audley Street, London.</p>

<p>The first cable tramway laid in Europe has
been opened on the steepest bit of road near
London—namely, Highgate Hill, and is pronounced
on all hands a complete success. It is
to be hoped that the system will become as
common in this country as it is in America,
where not only steep gradients are thus dealt
with, but level roads, such as our horse tramcars
already traverse. The boon to horses
would be immeasurable. At the present time,
on British tramways more than twenty thousand
horses are at work. The labour is so hard,
that about one quarter of this number have
annually to be replaced. This annual loss absorbs
forty-three per cent. of the gross earnings, a consideration
which will appeal more eloquently to
the feelings of many than will the sufferings of
the poor horses.</p>

<p>Referring to the epidemic of smallpox in
London, a correspondent of the <i>Times</i> gives a
valuable suggestion. He tells how an epidemic
of the same dreaded disease was quickly stamped
out in a South American village some years ago,
and although our great metropolis bears but small
resemblance to a village, the remedy in question
might nevertheless be tried. Huge bonfires
of old creosoted railway sleepers were made in
the streets, and gas-tar was added occasionally
to stimulate the flames. In the meantime, every
house where a death or recovery occurred was
lime-washed. With these precautions, which are
manifestly applicable to other zymotic diseases,
the visitation speedily vanished. Concerning this
all-important subject we may have something
further to say in a special paper.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there is no kind of doubt that
the spread of infectious disease is attributable
in great measure to personal ignorance, commonly
called carelessness, as well as to that
entire indifference as to the welfare of others
which is so common to human nature. Some
time since, an advertisement appeared to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">{478}</span>
following effect: ‘Should this meet the eye
of the lady who travelled (by a particular
train) with her two boys, one of whom was
evidently just recovering from an illness, she
may be pleased to learn that three of the
four young ladies who were in the carriage
are very ill with the measles.’ This is surpassed
by a statement contained in a recent
letter in the <i>Times</i>. A lady, finding that her
boys, on recovering from a severe attack of
scarlatina, suffered much from dandruff (the
scales which separate from the scalp, and which,
in fever, are a prolific source of contagion), took
the sufferers to a leading West End hairdresser’s,
so that their heads could receive a thorough
cleansing with the machine-brush!</p>

<p>We would in this connection draw attention
to a novel system of providing for smallpox
cases with the least amount of risk to others,
which is established by the Metropolitan Asylums
Board of London, and which will undergo in
time further development. In addition to the
five hospitals in different parts of London which
have been opened whenever a fresh epidemic has
broken out, there is a very elaborate ambulance
system, by which a suitable carriage with a
nurse and porter is despatched, as soon as notice
is received, to the patient’s place of residence
and removes the patient to the nearest hospital.
This has been at work for some years; but in
addition there are three ships moored on the
Thames opposite Purfleet, two of which are
hospital ships, the third being used as a residence
for the staff, and containing offices, kitchens,
workshops, &amp;c. Some four miles inland there is
a convalescent camp, consisting of tents for
about one thousand patients, each heated and
lighted by gas, and suitably fitted for the purpose
in every way.</p>

<p>To convey patients to the ships, an ambulance
steamer runs as often as required, being
fitted up as a travelling hospital, with beds,
&amp;c., and having a medical and nursing staff.
Patients are removed to the river-side either
direct from their homes, or from the hospitals,
usually on comfortable beds, and carried on
board the steamer, and thence down the
river. Another steamer brings the recovered
cases back; and when landed, they are conveyed
in special carriages to their homes, free from
infection in person and clothing.</p>

<p>So far the problem of how to provide for
an epidemic of smallpox in London is in a fair
way of being solved, by a system which, though
still in its earliest stage, is daily undergoing
development and improvement. When yet
another steamer is fitted out, there will be no
difficulty in coping with a much larger epidemic
than has visited London for many years, and at
the same time treating patients with an amount
of attention almost unknown till now.</p>

<p>The proposal to revive the art of lacemaking
in Ireland, to which we adverted some months
ago, has now received more definite form. A
scheme has been framed under the auspices of
many influential persons, the chief features of
which are as follows: Original designs are to
be purchased under the advice of the best
authorities on the subject. These designs will
be sent to the lacemaking centres for execution.
The specimens will then be exhibited and offered
for sale. The expenses to set this machinery at
work will amount to about five hundred pounds,
much of which is already subscribed. Full information
as to the project can be obtained from
Mr Alan Cole, of the South Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>Dr Von Pettenkofer has, according to the
<i>Lancet</i>, been lately paying attention to the
poisonous action of coal-gas on the human
system, and a few notes of authenticated cases
may be serviceable to those who pay little heed to
an escape of gas so long as it does not in their
opinion assume dangerous dimensions. The cases
quoted all refer to escapes of gas into dwelling-houses
after passing through a layer of earth,
and we may note that such escapes are difficult
of detection, for the earth robs the gas in great
measure of its tell-tale odour. At Roveredo,
three women were killed in their sleep by an
escape from a broken pipe under the roadway
thirty-five feet distant. At Cologne, three of one
family were carried off by a similar escape at
a distance of ninety-eight feet. At Breslau, a
case is reported where the escape was no less
than one hundred and fifteen feet away from its
victim. It would seem that the dangerous constituent
of coal-gas is carbonic oxide, which
usually forms about eight per cent. of the vapour
conveyed to our houses. Whether this noxious
ingredient can, like other impurities, be eliminated
in the process of purification at the gas-works,
we do not know, but the question is
certainly worth the attention of the authorities.</p>

<p>The Observatory on the summit of Ben Nevis,
which our readers will remember was opened
in October last, will be completed this summer.
The observations already made confirm the anticipations
as to the value of a high level station,
and the completion of the structure will add
to the efficiency of the work done, for hitherto
the observers have been cramped for space. A
shelter for tourists forms part of the scheme,
and travellers will be able to obtain light refreshment
there, and if they desire it, can telegraph
from the highest point in Britain to their friends
below. The cost of completion will absorb about
eight hundred pounds; but this estimate does
not include the heavy outlay for carriage of
materials on horseback up the bridle-path already
constructed. It has been suggested that visitors
on horseback using this path should pay a toll
of five shillings—a modest sum, when it is considered
that the expenses of maintenance are
much increased by the soil being loosened by the
horse’s hoofs, especially when the ground is in
a soft condition.</p>

<p>The small Chinese colony established at the
International Health Exhibition is one of the
principal attractions of the place. Visitors have
now the opportunity of tasting various strange
dishes which before they had only heard of by
report. The much extolled bird-nest soup can
be had here, together with shark-fins, <i>beches de
mer</i> (sea-slugs), edibles made of different seaweeds,
shredded cucumber peels mixed with vinegar,
and various other delicacies, which, we trust,
are nicer than they seem to be by mere description.
We may note that the South Kensington
executive have already arranged for an Exhibition
to follow on the present one. It is to be
called the Exhibition of Inventions, and will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">{479}</span>
include all kinds of appliances, one entire division
being devoted to musical instruments.</p>

<p>A long-felt want by paper-rulers and others
has now been supplied by the new Patent
Automatic Paper Feeding-machine. It has been
invented by Mr William Archer, 204 Rose Street,
Edinburgh—a paper-ruler who has spent his
spare time during the last ten years in working
it out, and who has now succeeded in patenting
a Ruling-machine which is allowed to be the
most accurate in use for feeding the paper in
a continuous stream, or feeding to grippers at
given intervals. It can be worked either by
hand or steam-power, and it renders unnecessary
the employment of boys or girls as paper-feeders.
It can also be applied to hot rolling-machines;
and it is expected that it will also be turned to
use in connection with printing, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>THE NEW ORGAN IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old-new, or the new-old, organ of Westminster
Abbey was formally tried on the 24th
of May, at the usual afternoon service, after which
a recital, which served to exhibit the extreme
beauty and power of some of the new work, was
given. The new organ has fifty-six speaking
stops, besides many mechanical stops, couplers,
&amp;c., and is placed in two lofty blocks, like the one
in St Paul’s Cathedral, at the west end of the two
choir screens, only that in this case the player
sits between the two over the doorway of the
choir. The magnificent oak case, designed by
Mr Pearson, has not yet been erected, because
the funds for the purpose—about fifteen hundred
pounds—are not, as we write, yet collected. The
principal bellows are blown by a gas-engine, and
are placed in a vault below the cloisters, the pipes
conveying the air being nearly one hundred
feet in length. A curious arrangement exists to
connect the keys with the pipes, which is done
by tubes, through which, on the key being
pressed, wind, under heavy pressure, is admitted,
and acts instantly on a small bellows at the other
end of the tube. This, on being inflated, pulls
down the pallet or valve under the sound-board,
and thus gives air to the pipe. This clever
system is said not to get out of order or to
be affected by changes of temperature.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to state that this organ
was in the first instance built by Schreider and
Jordan so far back as 1730. Exactly a hundred
years after (1830) it was added to by Elliott;
and again in 1848 and in 1868, Hill made many
additions; and it has now been almost completely
reconstructed by Messrs Hill and Son,
of the same well-known firm. It may fairly
be considered, with that in St Paul’s Cathedral,
and All Saints, Margaret Street, to take rank
as one of the finest church organs in London.</p>


<h3>THE ANTHROPOMETRICAL LABORATORY AT THE HEALTH EXHIBITION.</h3>

<p>Without intending the smallest disrespect to
our numerous readers, we will venture to say
that more than one will be inclined to ask the
very obvious question, ‘What is anthropometry?’
Well, this fine-sounding, Greek-adapted name
signifies the art of describing and recording,
in a schedule provided for that purpose, the
particulars appertaining to the condition, functions,
powers, and capabilities of the human
body and limbs. Every person visiting the Laboratory
at the Health Exhibition can have his or
her schedule filled up with a statement, ascertained
on the spot, of his name or initials, age,
sex, occupation, place of birth, colour of hair and
eyes, height standing and sitting, weight, length
of span of arms, strength of squeeze and of pull,
swiftness and weight of direct fist-blow, capacity
of chest, lungs, and breathing, as measured by a
spirometer, acuteness of vision as measured by a
test type, conditions of colour-sense, and acuteness
of hearing. The ascertaining of these particulars,
and any others of a like nature bearing
immediately on the principal question, seems to
be the especial business of the art of anthropometry.
It may be objected that the collecting of
these facts, though interesting enough to the
individual practised upon and his family, can be
of no possible use beyond that limit, or indeed
anywhere else; but the gentleman who has
originated this novel and ingenious scheme (Mr
Francis Galton) proposes to keep a duplicate of
the filled-up schedule which each person operated
on will receive; and by this means he hopes to
obtain a very large number of facts and statements,
which will doubtless be ultimately arranged
and tabulated, and made good use of by the originator,
who may possibly submit them to the
Registrar-general, or to the Statistical Society,
for enrolment amongst their curious records. It
is, at anyrate, in spite of its somewhat alarming
Greek name, an interesting experiment.</p>


<h3>ADVICE TO INTENDING EMIGRANTS.</h3>

<p>A correspondent in New South Wales writes
to us as follows: ‘Australia offers a wide field
for the capitalist and the manual labourer, but
I should not advise others to try their fortunes
here. For educated persons, male or female,
without capital, Australia is a death-trap. Such
persons would, according to my observation, do
far better in America, or in the English settlements
in China. In China, young gentlemen
possessing no other fortune than a good education,
are soon employed in the warehouses and
stores by the Chinese merchants, who value
Englishmen whenever they can get them to take
charge of the more responsible parts of their businesses.
The Chinese Customs’ Departments also
are open to educated young Englishmen. But in
Australia, brains are not a marketable commodity;
strong arms are more sought for. The streets of
Sydney are thronged with hundreds of educated
young Englishmen, who have come out here
persuaded by their friends that work is easily
got, as well as money, which is not the case,
except in one or two kinds of labour. I know
of scores of temperate young gentlemen out here
who have done all they could to find employment,
and failed; and at last have had to seek
relief in the Refuge. Some commit suicide out
of sheer despair.</p>

<p>‘No one, unless he can swing a pickaxe
well and is possessed of plenty of muscular
strength, with not too much refinement in
him, should think of coming out here to earn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">{480}</span>
his bread, much less make his “pile,” unless
he has some capital, say a few thousands, to
start a warehouse, or take up land and go in
for sheep-farming. Sometimes young educated
men, who bring good letters of introduction and
good characters also, are given government situations,
as I am thankful to say was the case with
me. But I should warn any educated young
man who has no friends here or capital, against
coming to Australia. Even where he brings
letters, he often has great trouble to get a situation,
as there are so many colonials’ sons hanging
about doing nothing. The towns are overloaded
with men, and the country is left untouched for
want of capital in the majority of those who
come out here.</p>

<p>‘Servants of all classes do well here; ten shillings
per week and board and lodging is the
usual wage for female servants good or bad;
and one pound per week with board and
lodging for male servants. Governesses are an
utter failure; hundreds are doing nothing here
now; and when they do get employed, they don’t
do much better than at home; sixty pounds with
board and lodging is the usual salary; but they
have to act as nurses often as well, for that
sum.</p>

<p>‘My advice to young gentlemen and ladies who
are thinking of giving up their situations at
home and emigrating to Australia in the hopes
of getting work and good salary, is—Don’t.’</p>


<h3>A CURIOUS DISEASE.</h3>

<p>The <i>London Medical Record</i> quotes some information
regarding a strange disease that
is met with in Siberia, and known to the
Russians by the name of ‘Miryachit.’ The
person affected seems compelled to imitate anything
he hears or sees, and an interesting
account is given of a steward who was reduced
to a perfect state of misery by his inability to
avoid imitating everything he heard and saw.
One day the captain of the steamer, running up
to him, suddenly clapping his hands at the same
time, accidentally slipped, and fell hard on the
deck. Without having been touched, the steward
instantly clapped his hands and shouted; then,
in helpless imitation, he, too, fell as hard, and
almost precisely in the same manner and position
as the captain. This disease has been met with
in Java, where it is known as ‘Lata.’ In the
case of a female servant who had the same irresistible
tendency to imitate her mistress, the
latter, one day at dessert, wishing to exhibit this
peculiarity, and catching the woman’s eye, suddenly
reached across the table, and seizing a large
French plum, made pretence to swallow it whole.
The woman rushed at the dish and put a
plum in her mouth, and, after severe choking
and semi-asphyxia, succeeded in swallowing it;
but her mistress never tried the experiment
again.</p>


<h3>ANOTHER UPHILL RAILWAY.</h3>

<p>The <i>Hôtel des Alpes</i> at Chillon, and the <i>Hôtel
de Mont Fleury</i> at Montreux, Switzerland, are
situated at no great distance apart; but the
difference of elevation between the two is over
two hundred feet, and the incline very steep.
To get over this difficulty, it is intended to call
in the aid of that mighty power which has of
late so prominently come to the front—electricity.
After a long series of carefully conducted experiments,
it has been determined that an uphill
railway shall be constructed between the two
hotels named, to be driven by electricity. An
electric motor will be placed on a car to drive
a cog-wheel; this wheel will gear into a central
cogged rail, and by this means draw or pull
the car up the ascent. Conductors placed beside
the central rail will convey the current of the
generator, which will be kept going by a five-horse-power
locomotive engine. It is, however,
in contemplation to drive the dynamo not by
steam, but by water-power, abundance of which,
descending from the hills, can be had close by,
and only requires utilising. This railway will
in many points resemble that up the Righi,
only that electricity will be its driving-power
instead of the odd-looking little engine so well
known at the latter place; and when it is
completed, it will certainly be a great boon to
travellers frequenting these beautiful spots.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
